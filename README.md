# Receipt Sheep

ReceiptSheep is an Express app built at Hack the North to optimize expense approvals for businesses.  First, users upload an image of their receipt.  The app, using <a href="http://www.abbyy.com/">Abbyy</a> OCR APIs, identifies line items on the receipts and their prices.  The user can then make any edits to fix mistakes in the image processing, before saving the receipt.

Whoever is to approve the expense can view the page of expenses with receipts, and either approve or deny them with the tap of a button.  Finally, an integration with the Intuit API allows line items from receipts to be stored in Quickbooks.
